# friskbybox
Openscad drawings for a casing for the Frisk By Bergen air pollution sensors.

This will be a complete casing for the "Frisk By Bergen" project's sensors. It is designed primarily
to be used to cut a master mold with a CNC milling machine, but can be adapted to be printed
by a 3D printer. Currently the panels are in separate toplevel files, and there is no
full model of the box. That may be made later, but is not required to make the parts,
though it will be nice for giving an impression of how the box will look in the end.

The plan is to make negative silicone molds of the parts and cast plastic parts for the box.

The following files are toplevel files:

frontpanel.scad - The front side of the box, with logo

backpanel.scad  - The back side of the box

sidepannel.scad - The sides of the box (two needed)

top.scad        - The top and bottom of the box

Remaining

The side panels are not finished. Air openings and some way to fasten the electronics need to be made. 
Also, the back panel need to have some way to fasten it to different things.
