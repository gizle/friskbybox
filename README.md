# friskbybox
Openscad drawings for a casingthe friskby air pollution sensors.

This will be a complete casing for the "Frisk By Bergen" project. It is designed primarily
to be used to cut a master mold with a CNC milling machine, but can be adapted to be printed
by a 3D printer. Currently the separate panels are in separate toplevel files, and there is no
full model of the box. This may be made later, but is not required

The plan is to make negative silicone molds of the parts and cast plastic parts for the box.

The following files are toplevel files:

frontpanel.scad - The front side of the box, with logo
backpanel.scad  - The back side of the box
sidepannel.scad - The sides of the box (two needed)
top.scad        - The top and bottom of the box

Remaining

The side panels are not finished. Air openings and some way to fasten the electronics need to be made. 
Also, the back panel need to have some way to fasten it to different things.
